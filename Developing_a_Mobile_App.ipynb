    " 1. What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",

    "         - We also compared the user chosen ticket against the historical lottery data in Canada and determined their winning chances by building a function called *check_historical_occurence()* for historical data check.\n",
    "         \n",
    " 2. What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play any number of different tickets?\n",
    "     - We built a *multi_ticket_probability()* function that takes in the number of different tickets the user wants to play and prints the chances of winning the big prize depending on the number of different tickets played.\n",
    "     \n",
    " 3. What is the probability of having atleast five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "     - We built a function *probability_less_6()* which takes the integer/s from 2 to 5 as input and prints the probability winning the lottery for the inputted number in a ticket."
