    "   * We found that this strategy is not effective as our analysis resulted in only *6%* of terms in answers found in questions. \n",
    "2. We studied how often questions are repeated. This we found out by seeing how often complex words (>6 characters) reoccur.\n",
    "   * We found that close to *34%* of the terms in questions are repeated. We think that studying past questions might be a usefule strategy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**In order to earn more money we analysed *high value questions (>800)* and *low value questions (\\<800)*:**\n",
    " \n",
    " - For the purpose we built a function that takes in a word from a *clean_question* column and adds to either *high value counts* or *low value counts* by checking the value of the word and returns the *high count* and *low count*. These counts, we termed them as an `observer counts`.\n",
    " - Using *observer counts*, we calculated *expected counts* for *high value counts* and *low value counts*. Then using *scipy.stats.chisquare* we calculated `chisquare value` and `p-value` for randomly selected *10* words.\n",
    "    * We observed that rarely a p-value is < 0.05, implying there are not many words with *high value count* among 10 randomly selected words.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We conclude that either by increasing the number of randomly selected words or by eliminating non-informative words we can get better results. "
